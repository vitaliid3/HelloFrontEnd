            Mickey Mouse is an animated cartoon character co-created in 1928 by Walt Disney, who originally voiced the character, 
            and Ub Iwerks. The longtime mascot of The Walt Disney Company, Mickey is an anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts,
             large yellow shoes, and white gloves. The name "Mickey" was suggested by Walt Disney's wife Lillian in response to Walt's original name, "Mortimer Mouse", during a train ride in 1928.
             Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable and universally acclaimed fictional characters of all time.
